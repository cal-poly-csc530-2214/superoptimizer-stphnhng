# superoptimizer-stphnhng

I downloaded the Aha superoptimizer and played around with some of the example frag C code that they had. I tried adding my own code for the Aha superoptimizer to try (following limitations set out by Warren's 2008 paper.

I did
1. multiplication (4+ operations not found yet...)
2. division by constants (size 3 operation found)
3. pythagorean theorem (4+ operations not found yet...)
